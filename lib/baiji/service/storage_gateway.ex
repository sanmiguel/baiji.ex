  AWS Storage Gateway Service

  AWS Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software
  appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure
  integration between an organization's on-premises IT environment and AWS's
  storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data to
  the AWS cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery.

  Use the following links to get started using the *AWS Storage Gateway
  Service API Reference*:

  <ul> <li> [AWS Storage Gateway Required Request
  Headers](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#AWSStorageGatewayHTTPRequestsHeaders):
  Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST request
  to AWS Storage Gateway.

  </li> <li> [Signing
  Requests](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#AWSStorageGatewaySigningRequests):
  AWS Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you send;
  this topic describes how sign such a request.

  </li> <li> [Error
  Responses](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#APIErrorResponses):
  Provides reference information about AWS Storage Gateway errors.

  </li> <li> [Operations in AWS Storage
  Gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html):
  Contains detailed descriptions of all AWS Storage Gateway operations, their
  request parameters, response elements, possible errors, and examples of
  requests and responses.

  </li> <li> [AWS Storage Gateway Regions and
  Endpoints:](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sg_region)
  Provides a list of each region and endpoints available for use with AWS
  Storage Gateway.

  </li> </ul> <note> AWS Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When
  you use these resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource
  IDs in lowercase. You must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it
  with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might
  be `vol-AA22BB012345DAF670`. When you use this ID with the EC2 API, you
  must change it to `vol-aa22bb012345daf670`. Otherwise, the EC2 API might
  not behave as expected.

  </note> <important> IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS
  snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing to a longer format.
  Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created
  with a 17-character string. Starting in April 2016, you will be able to use
  these longer IDs so you can test your systems with the new format. For more
  information, see [Longer EC2 and EBS Resource
  IDs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids).

  For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID
  format looks like the following:

  `arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG`.

  A snapshot ID with the longer ID format looks like the following:
  `snap-78e226633445566ee`.

  For more information, see [Announcement: Heads-up â€“ Longer AWS Storage
  Gateway volume and snapshot IDs coming in
  2016](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=3557).

  Resets all cache disks that have encountered a error and makes the disks
  available for reconfiguration as cache storage. If your cache disk
  encounters a error, the gateway prevents read and write operations on
  virtual tapes in the gateway. For example, an error can occur when a disk
  is corrupted or removed from the gateway. When a cache is reset, the
  gateway loses its cache storage. At this point you can reconfigure the
  disks as cache disks. This operation is only supported in the cached
  volume,tape and file gateway architectures.

  <important> If the cache disk you are resetting contains data that has not
  been uploaded to Amazon S3 yet, that data can be lost. After you reset
  cache disks, there will be no configured cache disks left in the gateway,
  so you must configure at least one new cache disk for your gateway to
  function properly.

  Initiates a snapshot of a volume.

  AWS Storage Gateway provides the ability to back up point-in-time snapshots
  of your data to Amazon Simple Storage (S3) for durable off-site recovery,
  as well as import the data to an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume in
  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). You can take snapshots of your gateway
  volume on a scheduled or ad-hoc basis. This API enables you to take ad-hoc
  snapshot. For more information, see [Editing a Snapshot
  Schedule](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/managing-volumes.html#SchedulingSnapshot).

  In the CreateSnapshot request you identify the volume by providing its
  Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must also provide description for the
  snapshot. When AWS Storage Gateway takes the snapshot of specified volume,
  the snapshot and description appears in the AWS Storage Gateway Console. In
  response, AWS Storage Gateway returns you a snapshot ID. You can use this
  snapshot ID to check the snapshot progress or later use it when you want to
  create a volume from a snapshot. This operation is only supported in stored
  and cached volume gateway architecture.

  <note> To list or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2 API. For
  more information, see DescribeSnapshots or DeleteSnapshot in the [EC2 API
  reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html).
