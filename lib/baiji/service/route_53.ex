  Retrieves a list of your hosted zones in lexicographic order. The response
  includes a `HostedZones` child element for each hosted zone created by the
  current AWS account.

  `ListHostedZonesByName` sorts hosted zones by name with the labels
  reversed. For example:

  `com.example.www.`

  Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some
  circumstances.

  If the domain name includes escape characters or Punycode,
  `ListHostedZonesByName` alphabetizes the domain name using the escaped or
  Punycoded value, which is the format that Amazon Route 53 saves in its
  database. For example, to create a hosted zone for ex√§mple.com, you specify
  ex\344mple.com for the domain name. `ListHostedZonesByName` alphabetizes it
  as:

  `com.ex\344mple.`

  The labels are reversed and alphabetized using the escaped value. For more
  information about valid domain name formats, including internationalized
  domain names, see [DNS Domain Name
  Format](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html)
  in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

  Amazon Route 53 returns up to 100 items in each response. If you have a lot
  of hosted zones, use the `MaxItems` parameter to list them in groups of up
  to 100. The response includes values that help navigate from one group of
  `MaxItems` hosted zones to the next:

  <ul> <li> The `DNSName` and `HostedZoneId` elements in the response contain
  the values, if any, specified for the `dnsname` and `hostedzoneid`
  parameters in the request that produced the current response.

  </li> <li> The `MaxItems` element in the response contains the value, if
  any, that you specified for the `maxitems` parameter in the request that
  produced the current response.

  </li> <li> If the value of `IsTruncated` in the response is true, there are
  more hosted zones associated with the current AWS account.

  If `IsTruncated` is false, this response includes the last hosted zone that
  is associated with the current account. The `NextDNSName` element and
  `NextHostedZoneId` elements are omitted from the response.

  </li> <li> The `NextDNSName` and `NextHostedZoneId` elements in the
  response contain the domain name and the hosted zone ID of the next hosted
  zone that is associated with the current AWS account. If you want to list
  more hosted zones, make another call to `ListHostedZonesByName`, and

  **ELB Load Balancers**

  If you're registering EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
  load balancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2
  instances. When you register an EC2 instance with a load balancer, you
  configure settings for an ELB health check, which performs a similar
  function to an Amazon Route 53 health check.

  **Private Hosted Zones**

  You can associate health checks with failover resource record sets in a
  private hosted zone. Note the following:

  <ul> <li> Amazon Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the
  health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public
  IP address to the instance in the VPC.

  </li> <li> You can configure a health checker to check the health of an
  external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server.

  </li> <li> You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the
  metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the
  alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the
  status of the Amazon EC2 `StatusCheckFailed` metric, add an alarm to the
  metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the
  alarm. For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by
  using the CloudWatch console, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User

  Note the following:

  Creates a configuration for DNS query logging. After you create a query
  logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log data to an
  Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.

  DNS query logs contain information about the queries that Amazon Route 53
  receives for a specified public hosted zone, such as the following:

  <ul> <li> Amazon Route 53 edge location that responded to the DNS query

  </li> <li> Domain or subdomain that was requested

  </li> <li> DNS record type, such as A or AAAA

  </li> <li> DNS response code, such as `NoError` or `ServFail`

  </li> </ul> <dl> <dt>Log Group and Resource Policy</dt> <dd> Before you
  create a query logging configuration, perform the following operations.

  <note> If you create a query logging configuration using the Amazon Route
  53 console, Amazon Route 53 performs these operations automatically.

  </note> <ol> <li> Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the
  ARN, which you specify when you create a query logging configuration. Note
  the following:

  <ul> <li> You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.

  </li> <li> You must use the same AWS account to create the log group and
  the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for.

  </li> <li> When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that
  you use a consistent prefix, for example:

  `/aws/route53/*hosted zone name* `

  In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to
  one or more log groups and the associated AWS resources, such as Amazon
  Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies
  that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so
  you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create
  for query logging.

  </li> </ul> </li> <li> Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give
  it the permissions that Amazon Route 53 needs to create log streams and to
  to send query logs to log streams. For the value of `Resource`, specify the
  ARN for the log group that you created in the previous step. To use the
  same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you
  created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with
  `*`, for example:

  `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*`

  <note> You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource
  policy. You must use the CloudWatch API, one of the AWS SDKs, or the AWS
  CLI.

  </note> </li> </ol> </dd> <dt>Log Streams and Edge Locations</dt> <dd> When
  Amazon Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging,
  it does the following:

  <ul> <li> Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the
  edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That
  log stream is used to log all queries that Amazon Route 53 responds to for
  that edge location.

  </li> <li> Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.

  </li> </ul> The name of each log stream is in the following format:

  ` *hosted zone ID*/*edge location code* `

  The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned
  number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with
  the International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport
  near the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.)
  For a list of edge locations, see "The Amazon Route 53 Global Network" on
  the [Amazon Route 53 Product
  Details](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/details/) page.

  </dd> <dt>Queries That Are Logged</dt> <dd> Query logs contain only the
  queries that DNS resolvers forward to Amazon Route 53. If a DNS resolver
  has already cached the response to a query (such as the IP address for a
  load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the
  cached response. It doesn't forward another query to Amazon Route 53 until
  the TTL for the corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how
  many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set, and depending on
  the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain information
  about only one query out of every several thousand queries that are
  submitted to DNS. For more information about how DNS works, see [Routing
  Internet Traffic to Your Website or Web
  Application](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/welcome-dns-service.html)

  Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone.

  `ListResourceRecordSets` returns up to 100 resource record sets at a time
  in ASCII order, beginning at a position specified by the `name` and `type`
  elements. The action sorts results first by DNS name with the labels
  reversed, for example:

  `com.example.www.`

  Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some
  circumstances.

  When multiple records have the same DNS name, the action sorts results by
  the record type.

  You can use the name and type elements to adjust the beginning position of
  the list of resource record sets returned:

  <dl> <dt>If you do not specify Name or Type</dt> <dd> The results begin
  with the first resource record set that the hosted zone contains.

  </dd> <dt>If you specify Name but not Type</dt> <dd> The results begin with
  the first resource record set in the list whose name is greater than or
  equal to `Name`.

  </dd> <dt>If you specify Type but not Name</dt> <dd> Amazon Route 53
  returns the `InvalidInput` error.

  </dd> <dt>If you specify both Name and Type</dt> <dd> The results begin

  Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains
  authoritative DNS information for a specified domain name or subdomain
  name. For example, you can use `ChangeResourceRecordSets` to create a
  resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web
  server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.

  **Change Batches and Transactional Changes**

  The request body must include a document with a
  `ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest` element. The request body contains a list
  of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered
  transactional changes. When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change
  resource record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes all or none of the
  changes in a change batch request. This ensures that Amazon Route 53 never
  partially implements the intended changes to the resource record sets in a
  hosted zone.

  For example, a change batch request that deletes the `CNAME` record for
  www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for
  www.example.com. Amazon Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and
  creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If either the
  `DELETE` or the `CREATE` action fails, then both changes (plus any other
  changes in the batch) fail, and the original `CNAME` record continues to
  exist.

  <important> Due to the nature of transactional changes, you can't delete
  the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch. If
  you attempt to delete the same change batch more than once, Amazon Route 53
  returns an `InvalidChangeBatch` error.

  </important> **Traffic Flow**

  To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use
  either the traffic flow visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console or the
  API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the
  configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with
  one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as
  www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You
  can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn't performing as
  expected. For more information, see [Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS
  Traffic](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/traffic-flow.html)
  in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

  **Create, Delete, and Upsert**

  Use `ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest` to perform the following actions:

  <ul> <li> `CREATE`: Creates a resource record set that has the specified
  values.

  </li> <li> `DELETE`: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the
  specified values.

  </li> <li> `UPSERT`: If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS
  creates it. If a resource set does exist, Amazon Route 53 updates it with
  the values in the request.

  </li> </ul> **Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record
  Sets**

  The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that
  you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or
  failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order listed
  in the syntax.

  For an example for each type of resource record set, see "Examples."

  Don't refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which includes
  all of the elements for every kind of resource record set that you can
  create, delete, or update by using `ChangeResourceRecordSets`.

  **Change Propagation to Amazon Route 53 DNS Servers**

  When you submit a `ChangeResourceRecordSets` request, Amazon Route 53
  propagates your changes to all of the Amazon Route 53 authoritative DNS
  servers. While your changes are propagating, `GetChange` returns a status
  of `PENDING`. When propagation is complete, `GetChange` returns a status of
  `INSYNC`. Changes generally propagate to all Amazon Route 53 name servers
  within 60 seconds. For more information, see `GetChange`.

  **Limits on ChangeResourceRecordSets Requests**

  For information about the limits on a `ChangeResourceRecordSets` request,
  see
  [Limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DNSLimitations.html)

  Deletes a hosted zone.

  <important> If the name servers for the hosted zone are associated with a
  domain and if you want to make the domain unavailable on the Internet, we
  recommend that you delete the name servers from the domain to prevent
  future DNS queries from possibly being misrouted. If the domain is
  registered with Amazon Route 53, see `UpdateDomainNameservers`. If the
  domain is registered with another registrar, use the method provided by the
  registrar to delete name servers for the domain.

  Some domain registries don't allow you to remove all of the name servers
  for a domain. If the registry for your domain requires one or more name
  servers, we recommend that you delete the hosted zone only if you transfer
  DNS service to another service provider, and you replace the name servers
  for the domain with name servers from the new provider.

  </important> You can delete a hosted zone only if it contains only the
  default SOA record and NS resource record sets. If the hosted zone contains
  other resource record sets, you must delete them before you can delete the
  hosted zone. If you try to delete a hosted zone that contains other
  resource record sets, the request fails, and Amazon Route 53 returns a
  `HostedZoneNotEmpty` error. For information about deleting records from
  your hosted zone, see `ChangeResourceRecordSets`.

  To verify that the hosted zone has been deleted, do one of the following:

  <ul> <li> Use the `GetHostedZone` action to request information about the
  hosted zone.

  </li> <li> Use the `ListHostedZones` action to get a list of the hosted
  zones associated with the current AWS account.
