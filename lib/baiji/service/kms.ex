  AWS Key Management Service

  AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management
  web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call
  programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the [AWS Key
  Management Service Developer
  Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/).

  <note> AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for
  various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS,
  Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic
  access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care
  of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and
  retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs,
  including how to download and install them, see [Tools for Amazon Web
  Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

  </note> We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API
  calls to AWS KMS.

  Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS
  1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy
  (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral
  Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later
  support these modes.

  **Signing Requests**

  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key.
  We strongly recommend that you *do not* use your AWS account (root) access
  key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the
  access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user, or you can use the AWS
  Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you
  can use to sign requests.

  All AWS KMS operations require [Signature Version
  4](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

  **Logging API Requests**

  AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and
  related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3
  bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail,
  you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request,
  when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how
  to turn it on and find your log files, see the [AWS CloudTrail User
  Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/).

  **Additional Resources**

  For more information about credentials and request signing, see the
  following:

  <ul> <li> [AWS Security
  Credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html)
  - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials
  used for accessing AWS.

  </li> <li> [Temporary Security
  Credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html)
  - This section of the *IAM User Guide* describes how to create and use
  temporary security credentials.

  </li> <li> [Signature Version 4 Signing
  Process](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)
  - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request
  using an access key ID and a secret access key.

  </li> </ul> **Commonly Used APIs**

  Of the APIs discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most
  useful for most applications. You will likely perform actions other than
  these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.

  <ul> <li> `Encrypt`

  </li> <li> `Decrypt`

  </li> <li> `GenerateDataKey`

  </li> <li> `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`

  Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Tag keys and tag values are
  both required, but tag values can be empty (null) strings.

  You cannot use the same tag key more than once per CMK. For example,
  consider a CMK with one tag whose tag key is `Purpose` and tag value is
  `Test`. If you send a `TagResource` request for this CMK with a tag key of
  `Purpose` and a tag value of `Prod`, it does not create a second tag.

  Returns a data encryption key encrypted under a customer master key (CMK).
  This operation is identical to `GenerateDataKey` but returns only the
  encrypted copy of the data key.

  This operation is useful in a system that has multiple components with
  different degrees of trust. For example, consider a system that stores
  encrypted data in containers. Each container stores the encrypted data and
  an encrypted copy of the data key. One component of the system, called the
  *control plane*, creates new containers. When it creates a new container,
  it uses this operation (`GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`) to get an
  encrypted data key and then stores it in the container. Later, a different
  component of the system, called the *data plane*, puts encrypted data into
  the containers. To do this, it passes the encrypted data key to the
  `Decrypt` operation, then uses the returned plaintext data key to encrypt
  data, and finally stores the encrypted data in the container. In this
  system, the control plane never sees the plaintext data key.

  Returns a data encryption key that you can use in your application to
  encrypt data locally.

  You must specify the customer master key (CMK) under which to generate the
  data key. You must also specify the length of the data key using either the
  `KeySpec` or `NumberOfBytes` field. You must specify one field or the
  other, but not both. For common key lengths (128-bit and 256-bit symmetric
  keys), we recommend that you use `KeySpec`.

  This operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key in the `Plaintext`
  field of the response, and an encrypted copy of the data key in the
  `CiphertextBlob` field. The data key is encrypted under the CMK specified
  in the `KeyId` field of the request.

  We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in
  your application:

  <ol> <li> Use this operation (`GenerateDataKey`) to retrieve a data
  encryption key.

  </li> <li> Use the plaintext data encryption key (returned in the
  `Plaintext` field of the response) to encrypt data locally, then erase the
  plaintext data key from memory.

  </li> <li> Store the encrypted data key (returned in the `CiphertextBlob`
  field of the response) alongside the locally encrypted data.

  </li> </ol> To decrypt data locally:

  <ol> <li> Use the `Decrypt` operation to decrypt the encrypted data key
  into a plaintext copy of the data key.

  </li> <li> Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data locally, then erase
  the plaintext data key from memory.

  </li> </ol> To return only an encrypted copy of the data key, use
  `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`. To return a random byte string that is
  cryptographically secure, use `GenerateRandom`.

  If you use the optional `EncryptionContext` field, you must store at least
  enough information to be able to reconstruct the full encryption context
  when you later send the ciphertext to the `Decrypt` operation. It is a good
  practice to choose an encryption context that you can reconstruct on the
  fly to better secure the ciphertext. For more information, see [Encryption
  Context](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/encryption-context.html)
